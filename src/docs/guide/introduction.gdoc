This plugin integrates the [RAP Widget Toolkit (RWT)|http://wiki.eclipse.org/WidgetToolkit] - a
web-based Ajax/JavaScript widget library similar to [SWT|http://www.eclipse.org/swt/] - into your Grails
application.

RWT is the UI part of the [Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)|http://www.eclipse.org/rap] - a web-ported
application framework that builds on the powerful
[Eclipse workbench|http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform]. RWT is provided in
[standalone|http://eclipse.org/rap/developers-guide/devguide.php?topic=advanced/rwt-standalone.html]
mode by this plugin, without the full RAP workbench or OSGi. Furthermore, it is also possible to use
[JFace|http://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace] for building the UIs.

RWT enables you to create highly interactive, desktop-like Ajax interfaces by only writing
Java/Groovy code. In contrast to the popular [Google Web Toolkit|https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/],
RWT is not compiled to JavaScript, but provides its own set of JavaScript widget which communicate
transparantly with your server-side code. Since basically everything happens on the server-side
(besides the rendering in the browser), it is not necessary to use DTOs or other transfer objects
to send show data on the client. The domain objects can be seamlessly used in the UI (e.g. via
[DataBinding|http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace_Data_Binding]).

The following pages will provide you with the necessary information to get started with Grails and
RWT. Have fun!
